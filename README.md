# Nova Network?
Yes, **Nova Network**. Nova Network is aimed to be a mostly private, closed source Nintendo Network custom replacement server, being studied and heavily rewritten based off of Pretendo Network open-source code. Technically, this is to be one of the first Pretendo Network alternatives (if you are mature enough to join it that is).

__All original code credit goes to Pretendo Network. Please give them some love!__
